Version 1.0.0
- First edition of the "doorcam" app. This app loads a jpg file every 1 seconds from a http URL when the app is trigered from the tile or from Domoticz.

How it works:

1. There must be added a new string variable to Domoticz "ShowDoorCamToon". Set this to "150".
2. A new timer is created to the webcam widget (3 seconds).
3. Every timer instance a get HTTP is send to Domoticz requesting the variable status of "ShowDoorCamToon".
4. The result is JSON so JSON is parsed and the variable result.value is checked.
5. If result is "200" then the camera app is shown full screen on Toon.
6. After the camera app is full screen a get HTTP is send to Domoticz setting the value of "ShowDoorCamToon" to 150.
7. The widget is still checking the Domoticz variable "ShowDoorCamToon" every 3 seconds.
8. If result is "100" then the camera app is closed (hidden).

What to do to make it work:

There must be added a new string variable to Domoticz "ShowDoorCamToon". Set this to "150".
Make sure that when the doorbell rings, the Domoticz variable will be set to "200".

Configuration od the doorcam App in Toon:
"camURL" : this is the url of the camera to the snapshot (e.g. "http://admin:admin@192.168.10.188/snap.jpg")
"domURL" : this is the path to Domoticz including port (e.g. "http://192.168.10.186:8080)
"idx"    : this is the number of the variable made in Domoticz (e.g. "27") 
"var"    : this is the name of the variable made in Domoticz (e.g. "ShowDoorCamToon")
